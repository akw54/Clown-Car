## Inspiration
Taking public transportation sucks. WE all know it. Lets get together in a clown car instead. 
## What it does
Clown Cars is a alt-transportation carpool service whereby drivers use their own cars to pick up riders (clown callers) along a pre-made driving route. There are many routes. Tons of them (not really). Riders select their pickup location along the route and hop into the clown car with the other carpoolers. Since drivers follow a predetermined driving route they are able to pick up new passengers and fill their car along the way. This allows them to maximize the money they earn by having a full car at all times. This worry-free, time-saving, money-saving way to get about your daily commute will a way of travel whereby you will never want to a public bus again. Riders get to enjoy a lower faire compared to other taxi services like Uber and Lyft because the clowns' car is always full along the route, essentially everyone is splitting the cost of a ride.
## How I built it
I found some really cool open data services api (Socra), I integrated the entirety of Detroits public bus routes and bus stops as an example of how this service would be used. The open data used are found here: 
https://data.detroitmi.gov/Transportation/2016-DDOT-Bus-Routes/kwh5-7vt7
https://data.detroitmi.gov/Transportation/SMART-Bus-Routes/agne-ypdd
I built the application using Ionic Framework with AngularJS and Google Maps API to plot the sweet routes and stops.
## Challenges I ran into
Google Maps Polylines is a pain to implement with public data
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Finishing this thing
## What I learned
I learned how useful open data is, and how it can be used to come up with some really amazing ideas that can benefit many people.
